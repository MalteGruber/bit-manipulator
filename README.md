# Bit Manipulator
A website I made a long time for manipulating bit fields in headers.

Converts infinite Decimal, Hexadecimal and Binary numbers. Calculates 2s complement signed integers and IEEE 754 Floating Point. The tool can extract bit fields of any offset and multiple pin these when extracting parameters.
